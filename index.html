Hi! I am a Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Computer Science student attending UC Berkeley, with interests in robotics, manufacturing, and product design. 
I love working with my hands and tacking difficult engineering challenges, and have the opportunity to test my skills thru BattleBots, competeting with Axolotl on Season 5 and Glitch on Season 7.
I spend my free time reading fiction, learning the flute, and visiting national parks!
