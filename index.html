<p>Hi! I am a Senior at UC Berkeley pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree with an Electrical Engineering & Computer Science minor, with interests in robotics, manufacturing, and product design.<p>
    
<p>I love working with my hands and tackling difficult engineering challenges and have had the opportunity to test my skills through BattleBots, competing with Axolotl in Season 5 and Glitch in Season 7, and a variety of internships at  robotics startups and robotics research labs.</p>

<p>I am passionate about startups and leveraging automation in manufacturing, logistics, and medical devices. In my free time I play the flute, read, and work on side projects. Let's connect!</p>
