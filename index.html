I'm an engineering undergrauate at UC Berkeley with a profound interest in robotics, manufacturing, and product design. These fields captivate my curiosity and drive my academic pursuits. 
I'm passionate about the potential of robotics to revolutionize industries, fascinated by innovative manufacturing techniques, and dedicated to creating functional 
and aesthetically pleasing products. Beyond academics, I thrive in startup environments, relishing the dynamic pace of innovation. I'm a hands-on learner, enjoying 
the process of building and problem-solving. My aspiration is to continue exploring these fields, collaborating with startups, and applying my knowledge to 
real-world challenges, all while making a meaningful impact in the world.
