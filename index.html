Hi! I am a Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Computer Science double major attending UC Berkeley, with interests in robotics, manufacturing, and product design. 
I love working with my hands and tacking difficult engineering challenges, and have had the opportunity to test my skills thru BattleBots, 
competing with Axolotl on Season 5 and Glitch on Season 7. I am currently working at the A-Lab at Lawerence Berkeley National Labratory as a Student Assitant, developing robot cells for an
autonomous material synthesis labratory. I am passionate about startups and leveraging automation in manufacturing, logistics, and medical devices.
