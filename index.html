Hi! I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering major with an Electrical Engineering Computer Science minor attending UC Berkeley, with interests in robotics, manufacturing, and product design. 
I love working with my hands and tackling difficult engineering challenges and have had the opportunity to test my skills through BattleBots, 
competing with Axolotl in Season 5 and Glitch in Season 7, and a variety of interships at medical robotics startups and robotics research labs. 
I am super passionate about startups and leveraging automation in manufacturing, logistics, and medical devices!
In my free time I try and find time to play the flute, am an avid reader, and occasionally working on a side proejct or two.
