Hi! I am a Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Computer Science double major attending UC Berkeley, with interests in robotics, manufacturing, and product design. 
I love working with my hands and tackling difficult engineering challenges and have had the opportunity to test my skills through BattleBots, 
competing with Axolotl in Season 5 and Glitch in Season 7. 
I am currently working at the A-Lab at Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory as a Student Assistant, 
developing robot cells for an autonomous material synthesis laboratory. 
I am passionate about startups and leveraging automation in manufacturing, logistics, and medical devices.
