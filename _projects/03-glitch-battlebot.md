## Introduction
  This was a project for the armor subteam for Combat Robotics at Berkeley, a student organzation that competes on the T.V Show Battlebots. I was tasked with improving the side and front armor panels from the previous design. 

## Design Considerations
- Easily removable after combat
  - Should only require 1 person and limited number of tools
- Shock Isolated from the frame
  - Reduces impact forces on the frame
- Protects critical exposed frame sections
  - Namely the weapon towers
- Deflects weapon hits
- < 1 inch ground clearance
  - Lower ground clearance allows for the armor to act as a wedge
- Modular
  - Is swapable with the wedgelet configuration of the robot
- Under 15 lbs
- Material: AR 500 Tool Steel sheets
- Tab Slot Construction
  - Easy to weld
  - Low cost of manufacuring

## Reflection
This project allowed me to apply some of the knowledge that I learned from building and designing Axolotl for Season 5 of Battle Bots, namely building a modular system that can be removed if damaged. One of the big failures with Axolotl was that if a section of the frame was totaled, the whole robot would need to get scrapped because **everything** was welded together. By making the front and side armor modular, it allowed for 2 major improvments: 
  1. The armor could be replaced, and as such 4 copies were made. 
  2. The armor could be isolated from the frame, allowing for it to not only deflect impacts but also *dispate* energy
Overall I think this project was a success, and it went on to be fielded in a number of robot fights.
