## Introduction
  The purpose of this project was to improve upon the current cap dispenser system by reducing its failure rate and increasing the total holding capacity of the dispenser. The issues with the current dispenser included jams caused by an active cap feeder mechanism and a tendency for caps to nest when left in a tower for long periods of time. The re-design of this system targeted these issues in two ways, first by making the entire system passive, allowing gravity to feed the caps into a position where the robot arm could reliably pick up from, and second, by rotating the caps 90 degrees, such that sides of the cap be the contact edge with other caps. This entirely eliminates the issues with nesting, however it comes at the cost of the caps taking more space vertically.  The overall goal of this project was to implement these changes to improve the reliability of the system by reducing mechanical complexity and moving parts.

## Design Considerations
- Cap Capacity
  - 60-100 Caps
- Cap Alignment 
  - Allow for repeatable robot arm pick ups
- Cap Detection
  - Track Cap Capacity with beam break or infrared sensors
- Passive Cap Feeding
  - Reduces Failure Points
  - Simplifies Programming Complexity at the cost of Mechanical Complexity
- 3-D Printable Body
  - Allows for rapid iteration of Designs
  - Reduces part count
  - Reduces Assembly Time
- Modular Design
  - Reduces the size of parts to fit on 3-D Printer Build Plate
  - Allows for faster repairs 
  - Allows for expansion of system to accommodate larger or smaller volumes
